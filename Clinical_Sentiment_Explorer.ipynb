I had my seizure when I was 16 and put on the wrong medication until I was 21 and picked my own doctor. To be fair this was over 30 years ago and my parents trusted the doctor and believed that my family physician could take over my care. Unfortunately that was not the case. My first medication kept me from having another seizure, but my myoclonic jerks were so bad that I would fall sometimes. When I picked my own doctor she ordered her own tests and diagnosed me with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. I’m lucky that is the kind that I have. There are 2 medications that are used to treat it. Advocate for yourself and never feel bad if you choose to have a second opinion. Contact your local epilepsy foundation. They are an incredible resource for information and support.

My Neurologist said “most everyone gets one freebie seizure before being diagnosed epileptic” but in my case they put me on meds due to combo of seizure severity AND an abnormality on my brain they saw via MRI. The “spot” they saw was exactly where I had a depressed skull fracture (waterskiing) 30+ years ago. Crazy experience….like I thought I was being “punked”. Today is 6months and besides getting tired in the afternoons and my general “executive functioning” only being 80%, I’d say I’m doing alright….just don’t like the thought of having another lingering in my mind.\n",

One day I felt one coming on and my teacher had me write my boyfriend’s number down incase it happened. I think a huge part of handling epilepsy is knowing your triggers. For me, it’s alcohol and sleep deprivation. I can completely avoid a seizure if I don’t drink and get plenty of sleep. It’s different for other people. Also my triggers have changed, I use to drink a lot and get very little sleep and was fine. Also, get in the habit of religiously taking your medicine.

Lamotrigine is what I personally take right now, and it is a \"mood stabilizer\".  For me, that means feeling almost nothing emotionally.  If he is still a young child and developing, and has that effect, this can be just as bad for him as the rage, in my opinion.\n",

There are days where the anxiety and grogginess leave me unmotivated or uninspired.. but therapy and routine have treated me well. I was diagnosed four years ago, went two years seizure free up until this last Feb. I make sure I get my omegas, eat my dark leafy greens etc.. if you’re looking for a good guide on nutrition, check out the book genius foods. Convinced me to add salmon back into my diet as an 8 year vegetarian! Also strength training!! For safety reasons I would suggest not using any crazy weight until your medication adjusts and you’re more comfortable/understanding of your diagnosis, maybe have a workout buddy.

I buckled down and took a more serious approach to it after I had a huge tonic-clonic in the grocery store when I was 35/36 yrs old. I fell on the floor, got a concussion, and had vertigo for a year. I went back on medication and have only had one since then when I forgot two doses in a row.

I barely slept that night (only about 1 1/2 hours, maybe 2) and another trigger was a broken flickering light at a clothing store. Luckily, I was discharged from the hospital after 4 hours. My second seizure was in September of the same year after I was told that my grandmother passed away from cancer. After that I was put on medication and got the official diagnosis. I was seizure free from September 2016 until 25 March 2023. I was visiting a friend about an hour away from me and barely slept that night (this time it was 4 hours) (thought nothing would happen since I was on meds…) but as I was about to take the train home at about 6pm, I had a seizure at the train station and went to the hospital. Got discharged a few hours later and my mom picked me up.\n",

It's not worth living life being anxious, so, for now, what I would say is control the circumstances you can control. That means avoiding any kind of triggers and be on a healthy lifestyle. Also inform people around you, there is the concrete possibility you'll get generalized seizures in the future; avoid maybe being in dangerous situation where that could happen.

            "\n",
            "A) Take your medication exactly as prescribed and on a relatively strict schedule.  Keppra is in your system for the \\~12 or so hours it lasts, and then it's excreted.

            "C) Do not take baths, and do not swim by yourself.\n",

            "D) Try to determine any stressors or triggers that led you to have a seizure, or any auras/seizures that may occur in the future.  For you, one of those is likely flashing/strobing lights, which they should have tested during your EEG.  Avoid those.\n",
            "\n",

Not only triggers, but what to look out for during auras, potential pre tonic clinics, and also how to respond if you DID have a seizure since, despite most peoples thoughts, ambulances are rarely necessary (unless there are certain factors present.) For me, sometimes when I'm dizzy I also like to remove myself from the group of our friends and go somewhere quiet and \"regather\" for a moment, and one friend will always find me and check on me if I'm gone too long lol. I also try to make goofy light jokes with my friends about it too (\"I only lost that game of cornhole since I'm epileptic, otherwise I would've beaten you!\" Lmao) so they feel comfortable, familiar and less scared about my situation if they were to have to confront MY disability face to face. I've had to explain what the postictal stage can also be like as well, and give them a heads up there's a pretty good chance I might've peed my pants too 🤣 ...

Make sure you keep a journal of your life. I have a simple diary where I note down the days my seziures happen and it is helpful for when speaking with a doctor because if you ever mentioned you wanted to trial another drug, or look into other options, for them to see your journal, they would have more respect for you really trying to sort out your own disorder. \n",

            "Comment Body:  Hi! I was diagnosed just under a year ago, so this is all fairly new to me as well. I feel like I can relate to the irritability and confusion. I remember feeling like I was living in the twilight zone my first few weeks on Keppra. I had no motivation, I was anxious and scared of the possibility of another seizure, and I felt down most of the time. It took my body a while to recover from my seizures (I also had two grand mals back to back with no prior seizure activity) and then throwing Keppra on top of it felt like someone had curb stomped my brain. With time, the Keppra side effects should wear off and your body will recover from the post-seizure ick. I’m sorry you have to be a part of this community, but we’re here for you! The one piece of advice I can give you is to not stop searching for answers. I’ve seen 5 neurologists since my diagnosis and I just finished my 7 day hospital EEG epilepsy study and we found my seizures are caused by electrical misfire occurring in my heart. I’m going in for heart surgery next week and after a year of 3-4 seizures a week, I will likely, finally, be seizure free. Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help. Epilepsy is lonely, but you don’t have to feel that way :)\n",

Keppra causes vitamin B6 and B12 deficiency which is what causes the irritability, depression, instability and general feeling of weirdness, cause it messes with your brain's balance. I take Vitamin B complex (which has all the B vitamins) with my keppra and it works great, I haven't had those side effects since I started taking those. You specifically need B6 *and* B12, not just one of them but both, according to a keppra study done in Germany. Good luck to you, and hang in there!\n",

Everything moves slowly with this diagnosis, meaning your body may just need to adjust to the meds (and don't underestimate how big of a shock the entire experience has been) but always always always keep the epileptologist informed especially if you feel like things are wrong. Trust your body. I had my first seizure in a bathtub (and drowned) right before my junior year in college. Was not diagnosed until I had a grand mal that became status epilepticus at the beginning of my senior year. I was in the hospital for 3 weeks that time--the second 2 because I was allergic to the first med they gave me and it caused brain swelling. The point being your story resonates with me. I don't know where you are with your credits but for what it is worth I dropped out the first semester. I was 3 credits short so the university let me graduate with my class and then I did a summer program abroad for 6 credits. I did not go home for that semester--although my family was also super supportive--because I had a very supportive social network and the idea of missing all of senior year really pissed me off. Having said that, the doctors wanted to put me on a temporary anti-depressant and my mom had a cow and looking back I wish I had. I barely got out of my boyfriend's bed that semester. Anyhoo, I have in many ways been where you are. OTOH my life was never the same, but OTOH my life was definitely not ruined.

I haven’t had a seizure since being put on the medication which is a very good sign, it is just my mental health that has been messed up since i’ve been home. I am a junior in college and commute to school, so not being able to drive all of the sudden will be an adjustment. our stories seem very similar. my seizure happened in my sleep as well when i was sleeping at my boyfriends house. we didn’t know i have a history of seizures, and this was so random, so it was very scary and traumatic for him too. this whole thing i don’t even believe is happening, but i’m glad i made this post to talk to people like you, it really helps\n",

After months of untreated seizures, I recently got diagnosed, apparently as a consequence from Covid. I am currently under Keppra, and was informed how lucky I have been not to have turned into a vegetable given the extent and duration of my latest seizures. But I am new to this. I don’t know what to expect. I don’t know if the side effects of the treatment are “worth it”. I definitely want to learn and I know this community will help me a lot doing so. I guess I am just afraid of “changing”. Not being able to be the woman I used to be. Not being able to share, or explain why I sometimes feel exhaustion will kill me.

Motivation has been something I’ve had to work on for quite a while.\n",

            "Selftext:  Hello everyone. My son was diagnosed with ASD when he was 3 years old, he is now 8. 3 years ago he had his first seizure like activity. He had a fall in school, no injuries due to the fall, but when he came home from school, he had a seizure, he was unresponsive eyes to the side, pale and limp. We took him immediately to the hospital where a brain eeg was done. Brain eeg was normal, no sign of seizure. Fast forward a month back, while quietly playing in his room  he had another one of the same seizures explained above. No triggers, he was just quietly playing when it happened again. Thankfully we were with him. Once again we brought him to the hospital, brain eeg was done. This time we saw a pediatric neurologist, who once again said eeg looked normal. 3 days ago he had an episode again, excatly a month after. Went limp, unresponsive. As it was a Saturday, and pediatrician was not in, we decided to wait until Monday to get further testing. Early on Sunday morning, he had another episode. This time, it was terrifying. Tonic clonic seizure for about a minute. We saw his pediatrician on Monday, and he is now on Epilim, twice a day. Seeing his pediatric neurologist on Thursday. \n",
            "I am scared. Terrified. I have not slept in 2 days as I just keep watching him. I am a bag of nerves. I am the worst version of myself now. I am here to look for comfort. No one understands what's it like to have an Autistic kid, who doesn't speak, only when he wants to, he cannot explain things to me properly. I am at my wits end. And now, epilipsy. Why him? Why me?\n",

            "Comment Body:  I’d recommend getting a camera for his room, it will help you sleep at night. We use a SAMi3 camera that alarms on movement, though typically my daughter makes a sound at the start of her seizures so we hear that before the alarm. He won’t remember the seizures themselves, but obviously the after effects can be difficult, fatigue, headaches, and depending on the type of seizures potentially bitten cheeks or tongue, or bangs and scrapes. Epilim can cause nausea, so make sure you give it with food, or straight after breakfast and dinner. I know this is a really scary time, I was you 10 years ago only for us the epilepsy came before the ADHD, and then autism diagnoses. You can do this, but it is a marathon and not a sprint.\n",
            "--------------------\n",
            "Comment Body:  Believe me , I get you. I have a 12 year old daughter who is autistic ( diagnosed at 2 years) and got her first seizure last week.My whole world has turned upside down. Her MRI was normal but EEG showed epilepsy patterns so we started with Keppra. With loading dose and 2 oral doses she developed rashes so as per advice we have stopped medicine. We are figuring out her medicine but I am not able to comprehend what the future looks like in terms of her personal, medical and social life. Being autistic was itself a big  challenge as she has behavior issues , non verbal and now epilepsy. My wife has resorted to god curing her and is a completely different person now.  I am taking life on a day to day basis because thinking far ahead makes me depressed.\n",
            "--------------------\n",
            "Comment Body:  This is incredibly hard to read, let alone comprehend what you are going through. I hope the seizures are only temporary, as when my mom was seeking a diagnosis for me (I was child), the paediatricians and neurologists didn't show much concern, citing that I am a child and that it is \"common\" for children to have seizures and it's only a concern when they reach puberty, as most children outgrow it.\n",
            "\n",
            "The only thing I can say is that your son is maybe confused about what's happening to him. The best thing you can do is be there for him and put him in the recovery position if he seizes again. Also, push for an MRI or a sleep lab test where they monitor him for a few days or induce a seizure to find it's source.\n",
            "\n",
            "At least, by your worry and concern, I can reflect now on why my mom flew halfway across the country when I had my first seizure and the constant doctor visits.\n",
            "--------------------\n",
            "Comment Body:  You are not alone, I COMPLETELY understand because I have an autistic kid who also has seizures. I do the same thing where I don't let him out of my sight if I think he's gonna have a seizure, it's like sitting on a grenade waiting for it to explode. Forget eating, sleeping, showering, peeing, doing anything. I get it!\n",
            "\n",
            "I do have some advice that might help, though. First, see if there is a \"Level 4 Epilepsy Center\" near you. They are all over the country and the Level 4 ones tend to have the most knowledgeable doctors and a greater variety of treatments. We didn't know about these centers and went to a series of pediatric neurologists who never told us there were other meds/other treatments out there and to be honest, they did not really care if our son kept seizing or not, it was like cookie-cutter medicine and they had no real regard for him as a person/human being. At the Level 4 center we go to now, epilepsy is all they do. And my son's epileptologist is ALSO a specialist in autism (autistic people are more likely to have epilepsy) and she \"gets\" autistic people, likes them, respects them, and wants to do all she can to help them. Our regular neuros unfortunately did not share this regard and they were not experts in epilepsy, it was just part of all the other stuff they did and it just was not enough for my son's complicated issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you watch your son and his seizures enough, you may be able to detect when he is leading up to having a seizure. If you can do this (unfortunately it takes a few, or more, seizures for you to learn it), your son's doctor can give you clonazapam, a med that you put under his tongue, it dissolves and will PREVENT the seizure from happening.\n",
            "\n",
            "For the record, my son's warning signs are: gets gray and clammy looking, gets withdrawn, no appetite, super quiet, does more repetitive things than usual, and can't play piano (he is musical and normally has no problem with this). Yours will probably be different, just passing it along to give you an idea.\n",
            "\n",
            "We have this seizure-preventive med and MAN, has it helped our peace of mind, plus now our son does not have to have seizures and fall down, etc. Just the day before yesterday he was going to seize and I gave it and prevented him.\n",
            "\n",
            "There is also a med called Valtoco that is a nasal spray that will STOP the tonic-clonic once it starts. You don't want to pile up these meds because they are sedatives, so ask your doctor about them. We call EMS if we use this one, just in case we need extra help.\n",
            "\n",
            "I don't know how much your son understands vs being able to say out loud--some autistic people comprehend a lot of things even if they don't speak much. There are \"zoom\" epilepsy support groups for young people and you will know if that would help him. My son \"attends\" these via zoom and he generally doesn't say anything but it makes him feel better knowing he is not alone and all those other people on his screen have seizures too.\n",
            "\n",
            "You are not alone, your son is not alone, my heart truly goes out to you. There is help out there and I hope these things make it a little better for you and your son.\n",

            "Comment Body:  In terms of what is happening between your wife and you, the same scenario is playing out at home for me. I am at a loss. I can't sleep at night, and I am constantly worrying about my son. I feel, overnight, I have changed into some person I don't even know or understand due to this worry. My husband is just like you. Take it as it comes.\n",

These methods are generally faster and easier to implement because they rely on predefined lexicons of positive and negative words.

These models, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), offer significant improvements because they understand the context of each word in a sentence relative to all the other words, not just in a predefined lexicon. This leads to a more accurate and nuanced understanding of sentiment, which is critical when analyzing discussions about sensitive topics like clinical trials and medical conditions."

I had my seizure when I was 16 and put on the wrong medication until I was 21 and picked my own doctor. To be fair this was over 30 years ago and my parents trusted the doctor and believed that my family physician could take over my care. Unfortunately that was not the case. My first medication kept me from having another seizure, but my myoclonic jerks were so bad that I would fall sometimes. When I picked my own doctor she ordered her own tests and diagnosed me with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. I’m lucky that is the kind that I have. There are 2 medications that are used to treat it. Advocate for yourself and never feel bad if you choose to have a second opinion. Contact your local epilepsy foundation. They are an incredible resource for information and support.  Especially if you are newly diagnosed. I wish you well and hope that you get the right medication on the first try.\n",

Asking because I’m just 6months out from my first seizure, a nocturnal grand mal where I lost consciousness, turned blue, needed cpr (wife’s an ARNP) and woke up at the hospital at 3am unable to talk. My Neurologist said “most everyone gets one freebie seizure before being diagnosed epileptic” but in my case they put me on meds due to combo of seizure severity AND an abnormality on my brain they saw via MRI. The “spot” they saw was exactly where I had a depressed skull fracture (waterskiing) 30+ years ago. Crazy experience….like I thought I was being “punked”. Today is 6months and besides getting tired in the afternoons and my general “executive functioning” only being 80%, I’d say I’m doing alright….just don’t like the thought of having another lingering in my mind.\n",

Firstly, I cutting out alcohol, leading to much fewer calories and no more hangovers—what a win for my health! Additionally, becoming more in tune with my body, mind, feelings, and sleep has empowered me to take even better care of myself. Regular doctor visits and prioritizing exercise have truly boosted my overall well-being. Plus, as an epileptic, I've completed three marathons and remained seizure-free throughout thousands of training miles. (And guess what?

I made friends with a random person online in a seizure group and they became my best friend. I think it’s important that those closest to you or who are around you all day know what signs to look out for if you might have one.. also what to properly do when you do have one. Let someone know where your rescue medicine is incase of a long one. I’m in college and constantly carry one on me. All my teachers know. One day I felt one coming on and my teacher had me write my boyfriend’s number down incase it happened. I think a huge part of handling epilepsy is knowing your triggers. For me, it’s alcohol and sleep deprivation. I can completely avoid a seizure if I don’t drink and get plenty of sleep. It’s different for other people. Also my triggers have changed, I use to drink a lot and get very little sleep and was fine. Also, get in the habit of religiously taking your medicine. Don’t skip a dose or think “I haven’t had a seizure in a long time, I’ll be fine without it” that was my mindset when I was a teen and I could’ve avoided so many seizures.\n",

I know it’s only been a week or so but I never want to see another surgeon again\n",

            "Comment: 8, had my first seizure in gym class at school. Amazingly, I never felt there was a huge impact socially but it was in the spring and I changed schools the following year for other reasons, so who knows... Having had it most of my life, I just adjusted. The medication worked to control it and hardly anyone knew I had it growing up. I didn’t manage it well in my young adult years, so I had more seizures, but still not a whole lot - every 1 to 3 years. I buckled down and took a more serious approach to it after I had a huge tonic-clonic in the grocery store when I was 35/36 yrs old. I fell on the floor, got a concussion, and had vertigo for a year. I went back on medication and have only had one since then when I forgot two doses in a row. After the concussion, I began to gradually realize, from talking to my husband, that I had lost a lot of long term memories that I'll never get back. I'm in my late 40s now, and it's only been in the last 5 or so years that I've really thought seriously about how epilepsy has affected my life. I've become curious as to what things in my personality or behavior could have been influenced either by the condition, the seizures themselves, or the medications.\n",

I was seizure free from September 2016 until 25 March 2023. I was visiting a friend about an hour away from me and barely slept that night (this time it was 4 hours) (thought nothing would happen since I was on meds…) but as I was about to take the train home at about 6pm, I had a seizure at the train station and went to the hospital.

It's not worth living life being anxious, so, for now, what I would say is control the circumstances you can control. That means avoiding any kind of triggers and be on a healthy lifestyle.

Not only triggers, but what to look out for during auras, potential pre tonic clinics, and also how to respond if you DID have a seizure since, despite most peoples thoughts, ambulances are rarely necessary (unless there are certain factors present.) For me, sometimes when I'm dizzy I also like to remove myself from the group of our friends and go somewhere quiet and \"regather\" for a moment, and one friend will always find me and check on me if I'm gone too long lol. I also try to make goofy light jokes with my friends about it too (\"I only lost that game of cornhole since I'm epileptic, otherwise I would've beaten you!\" Lmao) so they feel comfortable, familiar and less scared about my situation if they were to have to confront MY disability face to face. I've had to explain what the postictal stage can also be like as well, and give them a heads up there's a pretty good chance I might've peed my pants too 🤣 ...

I remember feeling like I was living in the twilight zone my first few weeks on Keppra. I had no motivation, I was anxious and scared of the possibility of another seizure, and I felt down most of the time. It took my body a while to recover from my seizures (I also had two grand mals back to back with no prior seizure activity) and then throwing Keppra on top of it felt like someone had curb stomped my brain. With time, the Keppra side effects should wear off and your body will recover from the post-seizure ick. I’m sorry you have to be a part of this community, but we’re here for you! The one piece of advice I can give you is to not stop searching for answers. I’ve seen 5 neurologists since my diagnosis and I just finished my 7 day hospital EEG epilepsy study and we found my seizures are caused by electrical misfire occurring in my heart. I’m going in for heart surgery next week and after a year of 3-4 seizures a week, I will likely, finally, be seizure free. Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help. Epilepsy is lonely, but you don’t have to feel that way :)\n",

Keppra causes vitamin B6 and B12 deficiency which is what causes the irritability, depression, instability and general feeling of weirdness, cause it messes with your brain's balance. I take Vitamin B complex (which has all the B vitamins) with my keppra and it works great, I haven't had those side effects since I started taking those. You specifically need B6 *and* B12, not just one of them but both, according to a keppra study done in Germany. Good luck to you, and hang in there!\n",

Dont be walking around alot without a person around. Dont be working or doing things that stress you out if u can. Just lay low. Good news is that your family is full suportive and that there willing to be there for you. But u will be limited on things, be slower due to medication,  And have some struggles, you will find a medication that works for you to where you can be seizure free. We are here for you man and if you wanna discuss more feel free to dm me.\n",

I have had one EEG done. The ER gave me Keppra, which made me feel so spacey and irritable. There was no way i could make myself keep taking it. My neurologist appointment was yesterday, and she gave me Tegretol. I'm hoping this works but is different from keppra. I'm not a fan. \n",

Be patient with yourself, embrace the kindness & rest. Give yourself time to heal, mentally & physically, be kind to yourself — vitamin B6 helps with Keppra mood swings, B complex is a great idea. Eating well & balanced helps too to give you a bit more energy, as well as lots of water. Lots of sleep too, but keep it on a good schedule so your body has as much routine as possible.  takes a couple of months to adjust to medicines & a new routine but this group is awesome & helped me so much, we’re all here to help & support.

Everything moves slowly with this diagnosis, meaning your body may just need to adjust to the meds (and don't underestimate how big of a shock the entire experience has been) but always always always keep the epileptologist informed especially if you feel like things are wrong. Trust your body. I had my first seizure in a bathtub (and drowned) right before my junior year in college. Was not diagnosed until I had a grand mal that became status epilepticus at the beginning of my senior year. I was in the hospital for 3 weeks that time--the second 2 because I was allergic to the first med they gave me and it caused brain swelling. The point being your story resonates with me. I don't know where you are with your credits but for what it is worth I dropped out the first semester. I was 3 credits short so the university let me graduate with my class and then I did a summer program abroad for 6 credits. I did not go home for that semester--although my family was also super supportive--because I had a very supportive social network and the idea of missing all of senior year really pissed me off. Having said that, the doctors wanted to put me on a temporary anti-depressant and my mom had a cow and looking back I wish I had. I barely got out of my boyfriend's bed that semester. Anyhoo, I have in many ways been where you are. OTOH my life was never the same, but OTOH my life was definitely not ruined. Take a deep breath, you have earned it and you have earned a grace period time to adjust, but if the seizures are under control I promise you can have a great life.\n",

I haven’t had a seizure since being put on the medication which is a very good sign, it is just my mental health that has been messed up since i’ve been home. I am a junior in college and commute to school, so not being able to drive all of the sudden will be an adjustment. our stories seem very similar. my seizure happened in my sleep as well when i was sleeping at my boyfriends house. we didn’t know i have a history of seizures, and this was so random, so it was very scary and traumatic for him too. this whole thing i don’t even believe is happening, but i’m glad i made this post to talk to people like you, it really helps\n",

There was no indicators in my past that would point to me having it (according to my mom, but honestly her flippant attitude towards healthcare and doctors gives me little reason to trust that she would tell me the truth if something did happen to me in my younger years). So me revealing it to my family meant I had a lot of confused looks and a lot of questions that were steeped in doubt on why it could happen to me.

I am 39, happily married, mom of 2, some would even say badass working mom. Well, those were the days “before”. After months of untreated seizures, I recently got diagnosed, apparently as a consequence from Covid. I am currently under Keppra, and was informed how lucky I have been not to have turned into a vegetable given the extent and duration of my latest seizures. But I am new to this. I don’t know what to expect. I don’t know if the side effects of the treatment are “worth it”. I definitely want to learn and I know this community will help me a lot doing so. I guess I am just afraid of “changing”. Not being able to be the woman I used to be. Not being able to share, or explain why I sometimes feel exhaustion will kill me. How can this be… I’m still processing all of it, but feel under pressure to make career-change decisions. Has it already happened that a diagnosis could be… wrong? Not that I want to be in denial, but still… this is all new to me, part of me cannot believe it.\n",

No clear genesis as to why it started so late in life but here I am. People have looked at me with pity, fear and caution. One person attacked me by the neck and punched me in the back of the head to induce a seizure. This was also the same person who adjusted my neck right before I had my first seizure. People tend not to want to hire me for jobs when I tell them I don’t drive. When they ask why I don’t drive, I would probably get the job faster if I told them I ran over a cop rather than the fact I don’t drive due to epilepsy. Its hard but groups like this seem to help.

Epilim can cause nausea, so make sure you give it with food, or straight after breakfast and dinner.

            "Comment: Believe me , I get you. I have a 12 year old daughter who is autistic ( diagnosed at 2 years) and got her first seizure last week.My whole world has turned upside down. Her MRI was normal but EEG showed epilepsy patterns so we started with Keppra. With loading dose and 2 oral doses she developed rashes so as per advice we have stopped medicine. We are figuring out her medicine but I am not able to comprehend what the future looks like in terms of her personal, medical and social life. Being autistic was itself a big  challenge as she has behavior issues , non verbal and now epilepsy. My wife has resorted to god curing her and is a completely different person now.  I am taking life on a day to day basis because thinking far ahead makes me depressed.\n",

            "--------------------\n",
            "Comment: This is incredibly hard to read, let alone comprehend what you are going through. I hope the seizures are only temporary, as when my mom was seeking a diagnosis for me (I was child), the paediatricians and neurologists didn't show much concern, citing that I am a child and that it is \"common\" for children to have seizures and it's only a concern when they reach puberty, as most children outgrow it.\n",
            "\n",
            "The only thing I can say is that your son is maybe confused about what's happening to him. The best thing you can do is be there for him and put him in the recovery position if he seizes again. Also, push for an MRI or a sleep lab test where they monitor him for a few days or induce a seizure to find it's source.\n",
            "\n",
            "At least, by your worry and concern, I can reflect now on why my mom flew halfway across the country when I had my first seizure and the constant doctor visits.\n",

            "--------------------\n",
            "Comment: You are not alone, I COMPLETELY understand because I have an autistic kid who also has seizures. I do the same thing where I don't let him out of my sight if I think he's gonna have a seizure, it's like sitting on a grenade waiting for it to explode. Forget eating, sleeping, showering, peeing, doing anything. I get it!\n",
            "\n",
            "I do have some advice that might help, though. First, see if there is a \"Level 4 Epilepsy Center\" near you. They are all over the country and the Level 4 ones tend to have the most knowledgeable doctors and a greater variety of treatments. We didn't know about these centers and went to a series of pediatric neurologists who never told us there were other meds/other treatments out there and to be honest, they did not really care if our son kept seizing or not, it was like cookie-cutter medicine and they had no real regard for him as a person/human being. At the Level 4 center we go to now, epilepsy is all they do. And my son's epileptologist is ALSO a specialist in autism (autistic people are more likely to have epilepsy) and she \"gets\" autistic people, likes them, respects them, and wants to do all she can to help them. Our regular neuros unfortunately did not share this regard and they were not experts in epilepsy, it was just part of all the other stuff they did and it just was not enough for my son's complicated issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you watch your son and his seizures enough, you may be able to detect when he is leading up to having a seizure. If you can do this (unfortunately it takes a few, or more, seizures for you to learn it), your son's doctor can give you clonazapam, a med that you put under his tongue, it dissolves and will PREVENT the seizure from happening.\n",
            "\n",
            "For the record, my son's warning signs are: gets gray and clammy looking, gets withdrawn, no appetite, super quiet, does more repetitive things than usual, and can't play piano (he is musical and normally has no problem with this). Yours will probably be different, just passing it along to give you an idea.\n",
            "\n",
            "We have this seizure-preventive med and MAN, has it helped our peace of mind, plus now our son does not have to have seizures and fall down, etc. Just the day before yesterday he was going to seize and I gave it and prevented him.\n",
            "\n",
            "There is also a med called Valtoco that is a nasal spray that will STOP the tonic-clonic once it starts. You don't want to pile up these meds because they are sedatives, so ask your doctor about them. We call EMS if we use this one, just in case we need extra help.\n",
            "\n",
            "I don't know how much your son understands vs being able to say out loud--some autistic people comprehend a lot of things even if they don't speak much. There are \"zoom\" epilepsy support groups for young people and you will know if that would help him. My son \"attends\" these via zoom and he generally doesn't say anything but it makes him feel better knowing he is not alone and all those other people on his screen have seizures too.\n",
            "\n",
            "You are not alone, your son is not alone, my heart truly goes out to you. There is help out there and I hope these things make it a little better for you and your son.\n",

            "--------------------\n",
            "Comment: In terms of what is happening between your wife and you, the same scenario is playing out at home for me. I am at a loss. I can't sleep at night, and I am constantly worrying about my son. I feel, overnight, I have changed into some person I don't even know or understand due to this worry. My husband is just like you. Take it as it comes.\n",

To be fair this was over 30 years ago and my parents trusted the doctor and believed that my family physician could take over my care. Unfortunately that was not the case. My first medication kept me from having another seizure, but my myoclonic jerks were so bad that I would fall sometimes. When I picked my own doctor she ordered her own tests and diagnosed me with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. I’m lucky that is the kind that I have. There are 2 medications that are used to treat it. Advocate for yourself and never feel bad if you choose to have a second opinion. Contact your local epilepsy foundation. They are an incredible resource for information and support.

I made friends with a random person online in a seizure group and they became my best friend. I think it’s important that those closest to you or who are around you all day know what signs to look out for if you might have one.. also what to properly do when you do have one. Let someone know where your rescue medicine is incase of a long one. I’m in college and constantly carry one on me. All my teachers know. One day I felt one coming on and my teacher had me write my boyfriend’s number down incase it happened. I think a huge part of handling epilepsy is knowing your triggers. For me, it’s alcohol and sleep deprivation. I can completely avoid a seizure if I don’t drink and get plenty of sleep. It’s different for other people. Also my triggers have changed, I use to drink a lot and get very little sleep and was fine. Also, get in the habit of religiously taking your medicine. Don’t skip a dose or think “I haven’t had a seizure in a long time, I’ll be fine without it” that was my mindset when I was a teen and I could’ve avoided so many seizures.\n",

It took me a while to adjust to the medicine my neurologist put me on but I’m feeling much better. I felt like crap and couldn’t do anything after my 1st seizure. It gets better, I promise.

            "Comment: 8, had my first seizure in gym class at school. Amazingly, I never felt there was a huge impact socially but it was in the spring and I changed schools the following year for other reasons, so who knows... Having had it most of my life, I just adjusted. The medication worked to control it and hardly anyone knew I had it growing up. I didn’t manage it well in my young adult years, so I had more seizures, but still not a whole lot - every 1 to 3 years. I buckled down and took a more serious approach to it after I had a huge tonic-clonic in the grocery store when I was 35/36 yrs old. I fell on the floor, got a concussion, and had vertigo for a year. I went back on medication and have only had one since then when I forgot two doses in a row. After the concussion, I began to gradually realize, from talking to my husband, that I had lost a lot of long term memories that I'll never get back. I'm in my late 40s now, and it's only been in the last 5 or so years that I've really thought seriously about how epilepsy has affected my life. I've become curious as to what things in my personality or behavior could have been influenced either by the condition, the seizures themselves, or the medications.\n",

            "A) Take your medication exactly as prescribed and on a relatively strict schedule.  Keppra is in your system for the \\~12 or so hours it lasts, and then it's excreted.

            "C) Do not take baths, and do not swim by yourself.\n",

            "D) Try to determine any stressors or triggers that led you to have a seizure, or any auras/seizures that may occur in the future.  For you, one of those is likely flashing/strobing lights, which they should have tested during your EEG.  Avoid those.\n",
            "\n",

I also try to make goofy light jokes with my friends about it too (\"I only lost that game of cornhole since I'm epileptic, otherwise I would've beaten you!\" Lmao) so they feel comfortable, familiar and less scared about my situation if they were to have to confront MY disability face to face.

            "Stress has always been the cause of the seizures. Personally, I suffer from PTSD and literally a week after first beginning to talk about my problems that happened earlier in life, I began having seizures.

Make sure you keep a journal of your life. I have a simple diary where I note down the days my seziures happen and it is helpful for when speaking with a doctor because if you ever mentioned you wanted to trial another drug, or look into other options, for them to see your journal, they would have more respect for you really trying to sort out your own disorder. \n",

I remember feeling like I was living in the twilight zone my first few weeks on Keppra. I had no motivation, I was anxious and scared of the possibility of another seizure, and I felt down most of the time. It took my body a while to recover from my seizures (I also had two grand mals back to back with no prior seizure activity) and then throwing Keppra on top of it felt like someone had curb stomped my brain. With time, the Keppra side effects should wear off and your body will recover from the post-seizure ick. I’m sorry you have to be a part of this community, but we’re here for you! The one piece of advice I can give you is to not stop searching for answers. I’ve seen 5 neurologists since my diagnosis and I just finished my 7 day hospital EEG epilepsy study and we found my seizures are caused by electrical misfire occurring in my heart. I’m going in for heart surgery next week and after a year of 3-4 seizures a week, I will likely, finally, be seizure free. Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help. Epilepsy is lonely, but you don’t have to feel that way :)\n",

Keppra causes vitamin B6 and B12 deficiency which is what causes the irritability, depression, instability and general feeling of weirdness, cause it messes with your brain's balance. I take Vitamin B complex (which has all the B vitamins) with my keppra and it works great, I haven't had those side effects since I started taking those. You specifically need B6 *and* B12, not just one of them but both, according to a keppra study done in Germany. Good luck to you, and hang in there!\n",

Everything moves slowly with this diagnosis, meaning your body may just need to adjust to the meds (and don't underestimate how big of a shock the entire experience has been) but always always always keep the epileptologist informed especially if you feel like things are wrong. Trust your body. I had my first seizure in a bathtub (and drowned) right before my junior year in college. Was not diagnosed until I had a grand mal that became status epilepticus at the beginning of my senior year. I was in the hospital for 3 weeks that time--the second 2 because I was allergic to the first med they gave me and it caused brain swelling. The point being your story resonates with me. I don't know where you are with your credits but for what it is worth I dropped out the first semester. I was 3 credits short so the university let me graduate with my class and then I did a summer program abroad for 6 credits. I did not go home for that semester--although my family was also super supportive--because I had a very supportive social network and the idea of missing all of senior year really pissed me off. Having said that, the doctors wanted to put me on a temporary anti-depressant and my mom had a cow and looking back I wish I had. I barely got out of my boyfriend's bed that semester. Anyhoo, I have in many ways been where you are. OTOH my life was never the same, but OTOH my life was definitely not ruined. Take a deep breath, you have earned it and you have earned a grace period time to adjust, but if the seizures are under control I promise you can have a great life.\n",

I haven’t had a seizure since being put on the medication which is a very good sign, it is just my mental health that has been messed up since i’ve been home. I am a junior in college and commute to school, so not being able to drive all of the sudden will be an adjustment. our stories seem very similar. my seizure happened in my sleep as well when i was sleeping at my boyfriends house. we didn’t know i have a history of seizures, and this was so random, so it was very scary and traumatic for him too. this whole thing i don’t even believe is happening, but i’m glad i made this post to talk to people like you, it really helps\n",

You and I both got diagnosed around the same time, and have probably been feeling some of the same side effects. i still don’t feel like myself and have not accepted that this is the new normal for now. i really don’t like that i can’t drive, i fully understand why, i just didn’t think or expect to ever be diagnosed with epilepsy. I think the hardest part for me is knowing i have no control over this, and this is just the way it is going to be now. you mentioned before that your doctor put you on tegretol. how has that been going for you? also you said you had 5 grand mal seizures, are u still in any pain on the daily? I had 2, and each day my chest still hurts when i take a deep breath in, and near my ribs hurt too. i am going to the doctor tomorrow though. we got this :))\n",

I am 39, happily married, mom of 2, some would even say badass working mom. Well, those were the days “before”. After months of untreated seizures, I recently got diagnosed, apparently as a consequence from Covid. I am currently under Keppra, and was informed how lucky I have been not to have turned into a vegetable given the extent and duration of my latest seizures. But I am new to this. I don’t know what to expect. I don’t know if the side effects of the treatment are “worth it”. I definitely want to learn and I know this community will help me a lot doing so. I guess I am just afraid of “changing”. Not being able to be the woman I used to be. Not being able to share, or explain why I sometimes feel exhaustion will kill me. How can this be… I’m still processing all of it, but feel under pressure to make career-change decisions. Has it already happened that a diagnosis could be… wrong? Not that I want to be in denial, but still… this is all new to me, part of me cannot believe it.\n",

We use a SAMi3 camera that alarms on movement, though typically my daughter makes a sound at the start of her seizures so we hear that before the alarm. He won’t remember the seizures themselves, but obviously the after effects can be difficult, fatigue, headaches, and depending on the type of seizures potentially bitten cheeks or tongue, or bangs and scrapes. Epilim can cause nausea, so make sure you give it with food, or straight after breakfast and dinner. I know this is a really scary time, I was you 10 years ago only for us the epilepsy came before the ADHD, and then autism diagnoses. You can do this, but it is a marathon and not a sprint.\n",

Her MRI was normal but EEG showed epilepsy patterns so we started with Keppra. With loading dose and 2 oral doses she developed rashes so as per advice we have stopped medicine. We are figuring out her medicine but I am not able to comprehend what the future looks like in terms of her personal, medical and social life. Being autistic was itself a big  challenge as she has behavior issues , non verbal and now epilepsy. My wife has resorted to god curing her and is a completely different person now.  I am taking life on a day to day basis because thinking far ahead makes me depressed.\n",

I hope the seizures are only temporary, as when my mom was seeking a diagnosis for me (I was child), the paediatricians and neurologists didn't show much concern, citing that I am a child and that it is \"common\" for children to have seizures and it's only a concern when they reach puberty, as most children outgrow it.\n",

I do the same thing where I don't let him out of my sight if I think he's gonna have a seizure, it's like sitting on a grenade waiting for it to explode.

            "I do have some advice that might help, though. First, see if there is a \"Level 4 Epilepsy Center\" near you. They are all over the country and the Level 4 ones tend to have the most knowledgeable doctors and a greater variety of treatments. We didn't know about these centers and went to a series of pediatric neurologists who never told us there were other meds/other treatments out there and to be honest, they did not really care if our son kept seizing or not, it was like cookie-cutter medicine and they had no real regard for him as a person/human being. At the Level 4 center we go to now, epilepsy is all they do. And my son's epileptologist is ALSO a specialist in autism (autistic people are more likely to have epilepsy) and she \"gets\" autistic people, likes them, respects them, and wants to do all she can to help them. Our regular neuros unfortunately did not share this regard and they were not experts in epilepsy, it was just part of all the other stuff they did and it just was not enough for my son's complicated issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you watch your son and his seizures enough, you may be able to detect when he is leading up to having a seizure. If you can do this (unfortunately it takes a few, or more, seizures for you to learn it), your son's doctor can give you clonazapam, a med that you put under his tongue, it dissolves and will PREVENT the seizure from happening.\n",
            "\n",
            "For the record, my son's warning signs are: gets gray and clammy looking, gets withdrawn, no appetite, super quiet, does more repetitive things than usual, and can't play piano (he is musical and normally has no problem with this). Yours will probably be different, just passing it along to give you an idea.\n",

            "We have this seizure-preventive med and MAN, has it helped our peace of mind, plus now our son does not have to have seizures and fall down, etc. Just the day before yesterday he was going to seize and I gave it and prevented him.\n",
            "\n",
            "There is also a med called Valtoco that is a nasal spray that will STOP the tonic-clonic once it starts. You don't want to pile up these meds because they are sedatives, so ask your doctor about them. We call EMS if we use this one, just in case we need extra help.\n",
            "\n",
            "I don't know how much your son understands vs being able to say out loud--some autistic people comprehend a lot of things even if they don't speak much. There are \"zoom\" epilepsy support groups for young people and you will know if that would help him. My son \"attends\" these via zoom and he generally doesn't say anything but it makes him feel better knowing he is not alone and all those other people on his screen have seizures too.\n",
